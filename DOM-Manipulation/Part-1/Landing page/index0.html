                Candidates for the Azure Fundamentals certification should have foundational knowledge of cloud services
                and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. This certification is intended for candidates
                who are just beginning to work with cloud-based solutions and services or are new to Azure.

                Azure Fundamentals certification is an opportunity to prove knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services,
                Azure workloads, security and privacy in Azure, as well as Azure pricing and support. Candidates should
                be familiar with the general technology concepts, including concepts of networking, storage, compute,
                application support, and application development.

                Azure Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based or specialty certifications, but it
                is not a prerequisite for any of them.
